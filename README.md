# Mechanics and Control of Robotics

A robotics-focused repository covering kinematics, dynamics, control algorithms, and implementation using tools like MATLAB, Python, and microcontrollers.

Includes general-purpose utilities for Denavit-Hartenberg modeling, transformation matrix computation, Jacobian analysis, and singularity detection. Future expansions may include nonlinear controllers, image processing, embedded systems, and full robot projects like SCARA.
